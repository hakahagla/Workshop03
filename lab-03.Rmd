# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

Image 1 has problems in respect in mathematics since the length of 1026 billion is similar to 765 million.




## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

Image 2 has problem in respect the data because the bar chart does not represent the data properly




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

Image 3 has problem in respect people since the dots heavily overlap and people may not identify




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
Wide format has normally have a unique variable that all others depend on and long format may have
several observations which has repeating variable values.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
Wide format because the other variables all depend on one unique variable faculty_type

How many observations are there in the data set?
5



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}


staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975","1989","1993","1995","1999","2001","2003","2005","2007","2009","2011"),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(x='Year',y='Percentage',title = 'Percentage change over year')

```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Include all the years
* Thicker lines
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(x='Year',y='Percentage',title = 'Percentage change over year')+
  theme(axis.line = element_line(size=2))


```
